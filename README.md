# signet

signet is a R package designed to handle the evolutionary analysis of gene networks.

From a biological pathways database, and a gene scores list, one could search for high-scoring subnetworks in biological pathways.

The method implemented is based on Ideker et al. (2002) heuristics, but several improvements are considered.
