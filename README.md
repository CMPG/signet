# signet: Selection Inference in Gene Networks

signet is a R package designed to handle the evolutionary analysis of gene networks.

From a biological pathways database, and a gene scores list, one could search for high-scoring subnetworks in biological pathways.

The method implemented is based on Ideker et al. (2002) heuristics, but several improvements are considered.


Search algorithm



Application

Data: we will use KEGG Pathways data, and scores used in Daub et al. (2013), consisting in scaled Fst over 53 human populaions, for more than 17,000 genes.

´´´
data(keggPathways);data(zScores)
´´´

First, we generate the null distribution of the subnetworks scores for subnetworks of size kmin to kmax. This may be a little long, so you can use data(nullDistExample) here.

´´´
nullDistribution(keggPathways,zScores,iterations = 10000)
´´´
Then, you can apply the simulated annealing algorithm on pathways of your choice. You can provide the searchSubnet() function a graph list, or a single graph.
