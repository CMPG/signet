#' Example of gene selection scores.
#'
#' A dataset of gene selection scores.
#'
#' These gene scores are the one used in Daub et al. (2013). For a set of SNPs,
#' a z-score has been computed to represent an overall genetic differentiation
#' among several human populations. A gene score corresponds to the maximal
#' value among SNPs located within a given gene.
#'
#' The table has been generated using the pipeline described here
#' ("Human populations project"): https://github.com/CMPG/polysel
#'
#' @format A data frame with 17918 rows and 2 variables:
#' \describe{
#'     \item{gene}{Gene identifier (Entrez gene ID)}
#'     \item{score}{Gene selection score}
#'     ...
