\description{
    Implements a simulated annealing approach to search for
    high scoring subnetworks of genes within biological pathways and to test
    for their significance.
}


\examples{
    ## The following example illustrates the workflow.

  \dontrun{
   ## (1) The user must provide pathways and score data in the same format as
   ## this example dataset:

   data(daub13)

   ## (3) Apply the simulated annealing algorithm on pathways of your choice.
   ## You can provide the searchSubnet() function a graph list,
   ## or a single graph.

   HSS <- searchSubnet(kegg_human, scores)

   ## (4) Generate the high-scores null distribution.

   null <- nullDist(kegg_human, scores)

   ## (5) Compute p-values and generate a summary table:

   HSS <- testSubnet(HSS, null)
   results <- summary(HSS)

  }
